My first suppository

Hello! I'm a marketing guy for a small software company and I've listened to their babble uncomprehendingly for too long!

I'm going to dig into coding as much as my time allows, and by the end of the year I hope to be able to carry on a 5 minute conversation about code without misusing a term or getting laughed at for bad syntax.
